	abstract = {Science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields change rapidly and are increasingly interdisciplinary. Commonly, STEMM practitioners use short-format training (SFT) such as workshops and short courses for upskilling and reskilling, but unaddressed challenges limit SFT’s effectiveness and inclusiveness. Education researchers, students in SFT courses, and organizations have called for research and strategies that can strengthen SFT in terms of effectiveness, inclusiveness, and accessibility across multiple dimensions. This paper describes the project that resulted in a consensus set of 14 actionable recommendations to systematically strengthen SFT. A diverse international group of 30 experts in education, accessibility, and life sciences came together from 10 countries to develop recommendations that can help strengthen SFT globally. Participants, including representation from some of the largest life science training programs globally, assembled findings in the educational sciences and encompassed the experiences of several of the largest life science SFT programs. The 14 recommendations were derived through a Delphi method, where consensus was achieved in real time as the group completed a series of meetings and tasks designed to elicit specific recommendations. Recommendations cover the breadth of SFT contexts and stakeholder groups and include actions for instructors (e.g., make equity and inclusion an ethical obligation), programs (e.g., centralize infrastructure for assessment and evaluation), as well as organizations and funders (e.g., professionalize training SFT instructors; deploy SFT to counter inequity). Recommendations are aligned with a purpose-built framework—“The Bicycle Principles”—that prioritizes evidenced-based teaching, inclusiveness, and equity, as well as the ability to scale, share, and sustain SFT. We also describe how the Bicycle Principles and recommendations are consistent with educational change theories and can overcome systemic barriers to delivering consistently effective, inclusive, and career-spanning SFT.},

	abstract = {In recent years, a wide variety of mentorship programmes targeting issues that cannot be addressed through traditional teaching and learning methods alone have been developed. Mentoring plays significant roles in the growth and development of both mentors and mentees, and the positive impacts of mentoring have been well documented. Mentorship programmes are therefore increasingly being implemented in a wide variety of fields by organisations, academic institutes, businesses, and governments. While there is a growing body of literature on mentoring and mentorship programmes, gaining a clear overview of the field is often challenging. In this article, we therefore provide a concise summary of recommendations to consider when designing and establishing mentorship programmes. These recommendations are based on the collective knowledge and experiences of 4 different emerging and established mentorship programmes and can be adapted across various mentorship settings or contexts.},

	abstract = {Biological science produces “big data” in varied formats, which necessitates using computational tools to process, integrate, and analyse data. Researchers using computational biology tools range from those using computers for communication, to those writing analysis code. We examine differences in how researchers conceptualise the same data, which we call “subjective data models”. We interviewed 22 people with biological experience and varied levels of computational experience, and found that many had fluid subjective data models that changed depending on circumstance. Surprisingly, results did not cluster around participants’ computational experience levels. People did not consistently map entities from abstract data models to the real-world entities in files, and certain data identifier formats were easier to infer meaning from than others. Real-world implications: 1) software engineers should design interfaces for task performance, emulating popular user interfaces, rather than targeting professional backgrounds; 2) when insufficient context is provided, people may guess what data means, whether or not they are correct, emphasising the importance of contextual metadata to remove the need for erroneous guesswork.},

	doi = {10.31219/osf.io/k3bfn},
	abstract = {Multinational video conferencing and online calls for training and community building have been commonplace for many organisations, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. These calls can be intended to be hands-on and interactive, but it requires conscious designing, pre-planning, and careful moderation in order to make them inclusive for a range of abilities. This article describes formats and tools for designing online training calls for accessibility. Measures include high-quality real-time or post-hoc transcriptions or closed-captions for spoken content in calls, providing writing-based interactive discussions, and consulting with experts and people with lived experience before any of these actions are implemented. Many of these options are cost-free, although sometimes for-pay alternatives may offer better accessibility if funding is possible. Finally, iteration and feedback are essential parts of accessibility design in participatory events including online calls. As organisers, we should accept that we may make mistakes and hence, ensure that we build pathways to enable evidence and experience-based improvements.
These measures will aid participation for a broad audience but may be especially helpful for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, people for whom the call language isn’t their preferred language, and people who are not comfortable speaking in front of a group.},
