## OSPARK 

In collaboration with [Digital Research Academy (DRA)](https://digital-research.academy/), the OLS team will contribute to the Open Science Promotion and Advocacy for Research Knowledge (OSPARK) project.

Started in 2025, this 2-year initiative is funded through the [Open Science Clusters’ Action for Research and Society (OSCARS)](https://oscars-project.eu/), and represents our approach to equipping the Open Science community with practical marketing and communication skills to help create visibility for services provided by research support infrastructures as well as for researchers and their research findings.

The OSPARK project aims to develop a training program implemented in a multi-week bootcamp with both online and onsite participation to empower members of the OSCARS Science Clusters and the broader Open Science community with evidence-based marketing and communication skills.

In the first year of the project, the curriculum for the bootcamp will be developed based on research into both current best-practices and knowledge from experts in the field. Once the curriculum is developed, the bootcamp will be iteratively implemented in the second year to fine-tune the curriculum and participant experience.
