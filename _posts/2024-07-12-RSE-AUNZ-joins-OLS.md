We're excited to share that [RSE-AUNZ](https://rse-aunz.github.io/) are joining OLS as our first [Fiscally Sponsored Community (FSC)]()! We'll be exploring this over the next year with RSE-AUNZ as they run their flagship [2024 RSE Asia Australia unconference](https://rseaa.github.io/). 

## About RSE-AUNZ


The community of Research Software Engineers (Australia & New Zealand) was formed in mid-2017. The community has grown steadily over the years and is now well over 450 members ![Graph showing membership growing stteaily over time from ~10 members in December 2017 to more than 400 in March 2023](http://rse-aunz.org/assets/RSE-Members-2023-03-01.png).

The [RSE-AUNZ website](https://rse-aunz.org) contains the goals for the community. In 2023, the RSE-AUNZ Steering Committee completed a [Strategic Plan](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21385392.v1) to be explicit about the community priorities are, and came up with a set of five strategic selection criteria:

- Does this make RSEs value themselves?
- Does this make Senior Managers value RSEs?
- Does this grow community or raise awareness?
- Does this or can this support Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)?
- Does this sit in the policy advocacy space?

If you want to join the community, sign-up to the [Google Groups mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rse-nz-au/join).

## RSE Asia Australia 

One of the major reasons that RSE-AUNZ wanted to get fiscal sponsorship from OLS was because of the flagship event with RSE Asia, [Research Software Engineer Asia Australia](https://rseaa
org).

This online event occurs every September and is attended by RSEs from many different research domains, all who work in some capacity with research software.

Without support of OLS they would not have been able to run this event, due to both associations being at the start of their organisational journey.

## Fiscal Sponsorship with OLS

Fiscal sponsorship is a relatively new program for OLS, mainly in response to the fact that people participating in the OLS mentorship programs ([Open Seeds](https://we-are-ols.org/openseeds/) and [Nebula](https://we-are-ols.org/nebula/)) often desire to take "next steps" for their communities or projects, but may not have the legal infrastructure to do so (e.g. ways to handle money, accounting, a registered organisation, etc.), or may have an institution they can work with that may not have the desired flexibility to meet their needs.
