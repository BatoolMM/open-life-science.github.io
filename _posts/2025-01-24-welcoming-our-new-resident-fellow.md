Sara is a researcher with an Open Science obsession that has led her to work as mentor and trainer in programmes like OLS-Open Seeds and NASA-TOPS for the past years.
She is very interested in Research culture and Community building and wants to bring all these skills to anyone involved in doing research. 

Following the Turing Way motto, ‘to make Reproducibility too easy not to do’, she has become an ambassador for Open research at all levels and is very happy to speak up and train (herself and others) whenever needed. 

As an OLS Resident fellow, Sara will design and develop a tailored Open Seeds programme for the School of Neuroscience community at King’s College London.
Her ambition is to leak Open Science skills all around Universities so people can learn about it as soon as possible in their scientific journey (but never too late!)
