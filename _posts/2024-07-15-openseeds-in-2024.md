## How do we sustain open science and open research as a business? 
2024 has been a year of change for OLS. Our original CZI core funding is winding up, with all four of the cohorts (OLS-5 to OLS-8) now completed. 

We weren't too worried sustainability until at least 2026, through our [NASA grants]({% link _posts/2023-05-05-NASA-grant-announcement.md %}), which now support the [5-week Nebula program]({% link nebula/index.md %}). Once [OLS-8]({% link openseeds/ols-8/index.md%}) wrapped up, though, we weren't entirely sure how to continue running [Open Seeds]({% link openseeds/index.md %}), even though it was our original, core program. 

## More diverse income streams, and a two-part OLS-9

The next cohort of Open Seeds will have a mixed model for delivery: partly grant-based, and partly contract-based. 

Tajuddeen will coordinate the Open Seeds cohort for [Catalyst project members]({% link catalyst/index.md %}). Applications are open to Catalyst project members in Latin America and Africa. 

In addition, we're quite proud to share that the [Digital Research Alliance Canada](https://alliancecan.ca/en/latest/news/dri-edia-champions-new-funding-opportunity-advance-edia-dri) has contracted OLS to offer a full cohort to EDIA-focussed grantees based in Canada - **the call for applications for $35,000 CAD and participation in the Open Seeds program is open until 17 July**. 

Malvika Sharan will co-ordinate the DRA-Canada stream of work, alongside the [OLS-9 Resident Fellow](LINK TO THE RECRUITMENT BLOG) - name coming soon. 

## When is the next open-application cohort coming up? 

We're still on the hunt for funders to support OLS-10 and onwards, whether service-based contract or grant-based. Interested? A full in-house 16-week cohort for a high-income-country based organisation is usually around $200,000 USD. This supports up to 45 mentors, 30 speakers, and 45 teams/individual mentees. It also builds in the participation costs for microgrants for participants in lower/middle-income settings. Contact (team, Yo or Malvika) at [{{ site.email|replace:'@','[at]' }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) to discuss options.
