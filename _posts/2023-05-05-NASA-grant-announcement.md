For many, 2023 is the [Year of Open Science](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-advance-open-and-equitable-research/). OLS and [MetaDocencia (MD)](https://www.metadocencia.org/) are delighted to announce that we will be participating in the Year of Open Science by **delivering Open Science training** for **[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)**, using materials originally developed by [a huge group of open researchers worldwide](https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content/#contributors), alongside [American Geophysical Union (AGU)](https://www.agu.org/).

## What will we do? 

Spanish is the **second most spoken language in the United States**, after English. When NASA launched the grant call, MD & OLS partnered to propose a **dual Spanish/English language set of training cohorts** using our expertise in online virtual cohort training and Spanish-language education. [**We are delighted to share that we've been awarded a three-year grant to deliver this training!**](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/releases/2023/nasa-boosts-open-science-through-innovative-training/)

The training will cover [the five modules in OpenCore](https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content), and participants will work with a mentor to discuss real-world application of the skills they use. The schedule for individual cohorts is shown below:

We plan to run **five cohorts per year**. 
  
## What's the difference between this and OLS's traditional mentorship training? 

We foresee this being very similar to what we already did, but **more condensed** - rather than ~2 hours over 16 weeks, participants will be spending ~4 hours over 6 weeks. We may also add **additional seminars and group discussions** to cover topics that were in the OLS curriculum historically, but that aren't part of OpenCore. 

## What does this mean for OLS and MetaDocencia? 

In a word: **Sustainability**. 

We're delighted to have a **three-year roadmap** to help us keep **doing the work we love**. We'd also spent time **brainstorming ways to collaborate** as organisations, and one of our biggest **joint dreams** was to run *EspaÃ±OLS* - Spanish-language-first open research training.

After OLS-8, we'll probably take a break from the longer-format mentoring cohorts (recently rebranded to be "Open Seeds"), at the very least until we get comfortable with running these shorter, more intense cohorts. This break will also give us time to [further evaluate and understand the impact of OLS-1 to -8](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2022/02/18/ols-is-hiring/), and to invest into [localizing Open Seeds](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2022/12/20/ECB-grant-announcement/). That said - one of the biggest focuses for OLS and MD has _always_ been global community, so we're still looking for different ways to fund and support our networking, our global opportunity and skillsharing, and the compassion and love we get from you all.
