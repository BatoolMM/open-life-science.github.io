In my previous post, I reflected on my CW25 experience. One highlight from that week was **meeting more of the OLS community in person** — including core team members I’d only ever seen in squares on a Zoom screen. On Thursday, **May 15th**, after the CW25 Hack Day, we boarded a train and set off for our **annual retreat in Edinburgh**.

Of course, once we arrived at the station, Yo Yehudi — our Executive Director — set off ahead of us on her bicycle. Some would say she went ahead to prep the Airbnb… but we all know Yo just wanted to claim the best room. 😉

## Breathing the Same Air

The **OLS Retreat**, held on May 16th, was the **first time in a long time that many of us got to share physical space** — breathing the same air, exchanging actual hugs, and making the kind of memories that just don’t translate through a screen.

I love my colleagues, even as pixelated boxes…but in person? Even more.

And no, it wasn’t all sticky notes and strategy sessions (though there were a few of those). It was deeper. Softer. Braver.

## Team Values, Personal Reflections

We started the day with a **values-based reflection exercise**. Each of us wrote down our personal values, then went around adding positive qualities we saw in others — things they might not realise about themselves.

> “I love how you’re able to make people feel like they are part of your family — but not in a creepy way.”  
> — *Bethan Iley*, and yes, this made my week.

There was a calm moment in the room as everyone let those words land.

Afterward, we mapped these personal values to team values and behaviors that support them. **Kindness. Balance. Joy. Curiosity. Accountability. Collaboration.**

I had this discussion with Malvika on the porch, sunlight pouring in, a glass of juice in hand. One of those rare, golden moments.

## Vulnerability at Work? Yes, Please.

One of the biggest takeaways from our time together: **vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness**.

It’s okay to admit when you’re not feeling like yourself. [Presenteeism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presenteeism) — just showing up to tick the box — serves no one, least of all ourselves.

OLS doesn’t just talk about inclusive spaces. We *live* them. Even at lunch.

## Speaking of Lunch…

You could feel the care woven into every detail — especially when it came to food.

Despite our varying dietary needs (vegan, gluten-free, carnivore), ordering food was never chaotic. Menus were reviewed in advance. 
Preferences and restrictions were thoughtfully considered.

At lunch, I ordered a meat-based sandwich that unexpectedly came loaded with veggies. 
Patricia noticed me silently fighting a losing battle to de-veggie the thing and made a funny remark. I couldn’t help but laugh at this.

Also, every time someone bought something, Bethan would chime in:

> **“Keep the receipt!”**
> That finance officer energy triggered an outburst of giggles, every single time.

## Big Questions, Bold Dreams

Post-lunch, we turned to **reflections on the future of OLS**. These weren’t vague strategy chats. They were real, candid conversations.

What do we want to see more of? What’s missing? What would we build if we could?

There were laughs. There were truth bombs. There was hope.

## Final Thoughts

Being in the same room with this brilliant, warm-hearted group — brainstorming, laughing, commiserating — reminded me of what we’re really building here.

Open science is great online, but my advice to any remote team is: **make room for in-person meetups**, even if it’s just local ones.

They’re not just about work – but pouring into each other’s cups.

So here’s to more retreats, more veggie-loaded sandwiches, and more moments that remind us that showing up — fully, vulnerably, and honestly — is more than enough.
