# Seeking feedback from our community members on proposed organisational values: Your Voice Matters!

At OLS, our community is at the heart of everything we do. To ensure our core principles reflect and represent the collective vision and aspirations of our members, we are delighted to share the revised **draft of our Organisational Values, which is now open for community review!**

**The Community Review Period runs throughout April and May 2025, with the last day for comments being 30th May 2025.**

## Background

This draft of OLS's values is the result of discussions, co-creation and internal review from the OLS Team and our Governance Advisory Committee in 2023 and 2024.
We have taken the time to reflect on what defines OLS since our launch in 2020, and how we want to operate as a community-driven organisation over the coming years.

Now, we're opening the draft for community review via a Google Document.
We have shared details on the OLS-Governance GitHub Repository ([issue #12](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-governance/issues/12)), where all comments will be summarised and shared periodically.

### Who is in our community

Our community members include Open Seeds and Nebula fellows, mentors, experts and collaborators of the OLS community.
Your perspective is crucial in shaping the foundational values of OLS that resonate with and guide the work of everyone involved.

## How to Share Your Feedback

We've made it easy for you to contribute your thoughts directly via a Google Document.
You can access the [draft in comment mode here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SeAqomXt_ZrTYUQydOmqLgnI8tGxtCpr22Wu9xm5Y9g/edit?tab=t.0)
