As researchers, we value evidenced-based behaviours. This means one of our core focuses is creating the community-based, landscape and longitudinal analyses that inform open, equitable research practices. We aim to spread effective techniques and reduce ineffective techniques. Studies are run by experienced hands-on hands-on practitioners of open research and open community.

## What makes us different:
- Researchers with demonstrated track record in researching and influencing open.
- Inclusivity and equity-focused approach to research: train and incubate independent research leaders, compensate contributors, foster collaborations.
