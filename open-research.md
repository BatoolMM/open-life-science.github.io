# Open Research
As researchers, we value evidenced-based behaviours. This means one of our core focuses is creating the community-based, landscape and longitudinal analyses that inform open, equitable research practices. We aim to spread effective techniques and reduce ineffective techniques. Studies are run by experienced hands-on hands-on practitioners of open research and open community.
