# Seeds to Systems Research

Research is fundamental to OLS.
Under the "Seeds to Systems" strategic phase, research led by our team will ensure that OLS's training and operations are rooted in evidence and best practices.

Research conducted under this theme will directly inform and shape our other missions, ensuring they address the real-world skills and resources needed to lead and manage sustainable projects.

This research is funded by CZI Open Science (2024-2026).

## Leverage points for community and project sustainability

This research will combine open science with methodologies drawn from sustainability research to explore and understand the needs, opportunities, and challenges faced by researchers, and identify key learning modules, the "leverage points", for designing the Seeds to Systems curriculum.

## Research Funding Ecosystem

This research will combine interdisciplinary approaches to map, organise and document resources that will be combined to both improve our Seeds to Systems curriculum, and offer standalone references for research funding and sustainability.
