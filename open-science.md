# What is Open Science?

Open science is the *movement to make* scientific research, data and dissemination *accessible* to *all levels* of an inquiring *society*. - FOSTER Taxonomy.

It encompasses *unhindered access* to scientific articles, access to data from public research, and collaborative research enabled by [...] tools and incentives. - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

Set of principles and practices that make scientific research from all fields accessible to everyone â€“ for the benefits of scientists and society as a whole.
 
Making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable and sustainable. - UNESCO
