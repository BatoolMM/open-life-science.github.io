# What is Open Science?

Open science is the **movement to make** scientific research, data and dissemination **accessible** to **all levels** of an inquiring **society**. - *FOSTER Taxonomy*.

It encompasses **unhindered access** to scientific articles, access to data from public research, and collaborative research enabled by [...] tools and incentives. - *Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)*

It is a set of principles and practices that make scientific research from all fields accessible to everyone â€“ for the benefits of scientists and **society** as a whole.
 
Making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable and sustainable. - *UNESCO*
