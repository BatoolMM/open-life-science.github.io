# OLS Fiscally Sponsored Community (FSC) policies

## Contacting OLS

We maintain a fiscally sponsored community inbox that is monitored by multiple people in the FSC team (currently Bethan, Patricia, and Yo.) Emails to [{{ site.fsc_email|replace:'@','[at]' }}](mailto:{{ site.fsc_email }}) will generally be answered within five business days. 

## FSC policies

### General
- Please notify OLS at least one month before any grant deadline to share planned budgets and activities - ideally longer. This is particularly important when a larger number of payments or communications will be needed, in order to plan our workload. We'll work with you to find a mutually agreeable timeline. 

### Contracts and documentation

 When we onboard an FSC, we go through two steps: 

- **Agreement in principle** (for scenarios when we know money _might_ come, but it hasn't happened yet - e.g. a grant proposal is being submitted but not yet awarded, or a consultancy contract is being drafted). 
    - You can preview the in-principle agreement here: [DOCX](in-principle-agreement/fsc-in-principle-agreement.docx), [ODT](in-principle-agreement/fsc-in-principle-agreement.odt), [Markdown](in-principle-agreement/fsc-in-principle-agreement.md), [PDF](in-principle-agreement/fsc-in-principle-agreement.pdf)
- **Fiscal hosting contract** 
    - You can preview the contract here: [DOCX](fsc-contract/fsc-contract.docx), [ODT](fsc-contract/fsc-contract.odt), [Markdown](fsc-contract/fsc-contract.md), [PDF](fsc-contract/fsc-contract.pdf).  We apologise, it's wordy and in lawyerese! The docx and odt file formats have comments that may help reading and understanding the contract. 
    - If something doesn't sit right or isn't clear, we're happy to talk about what adjustments can be made. Due to legal restrictions, there may be times we can't flex the way we'd prefer, but we'll always try to do our best.
