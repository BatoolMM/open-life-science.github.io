   1. With effect from the Effective Date, each Community Member shall:

      1. be jointly and severally bound to OLS in respect of the Services as OLS shall be bound to the Grantor under the Main Contract (except as specifically provided in this Agreement); 

      2. perform the Services with the highest level of care, skill and diligence; and

      3. not act in any manner which in the opinion of OLS brings or is likely to bring the reputation of OLS or the Grantor into disrepute.   

   2. The terms and conditions of the Main Contract shall apply on a back-to-back basis to this Agreement as between OLS and each Community Member, so that OLS and each  Community Member shall have in respect of each other and in relation to the Services the same rights, benefits, duties, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities under this Agreement as the Grantor and OLS have in respect of each other in relation to the services to be provided under the Main Contract.

   3. Except as further provided in this Agreement, the Main Contract shall be used to determine the respective rights and duties of OLS and the Community under this Agreement except that wherever in the Main Contract there is a reference to OLS or a term referring to the OLS, for the purposes of this Agreement a reference to the Community or a term referring to the Community shall be substituted.

   4. Where any term of this Agreement conflicts or is inconsistent with the terms of the Main Contract, the terms and provisions of \[this Agreement / the Main Contract\] shall prevail.

   5. Each Community Member, who agrees that they have full knowledge and understanding of the Main Contract and of the Services to be provided under this Agreement, shall:

      1. perform the Services as set out in Schedule 3, and not make any changes to the Services without OLS's prior written approval;

      2. keep all invoices, receipts, and accounts and any other relevant documents relating to the expenditure of the Funds and the provision of the Services for a period of at least \[six (6)\] years following receipt of any Funds to which they related.  OLS shall have the right to review, at OLS's reasonable request, the Community's accounts and records that relate to the expenditure of the Funds and the provision of the Services, with OLS having the right to take copies of such accounts and records

      3. shall keep complete and accurate records of all Services provided under this Agreement for \[6\] years after its termination or expiry, and shall provide any such records on request to OLS or the Grantor, or allow either of them to inspect such records at any time on reasonable notice; 

      4. not constitute, cause or contribute to a breach of any of OLS's obligations under the Main Contract;

      5. comply with all reasonable requirements of OLS in performing the Community Member's obligations under this Agreement; and

      6. give a report, return, account or notice or such other information in writing to OLS as will enable OLS to comply with the requirements of the Main Contract.

   6. Nothing herein shall be construed as creating any privity of contract between each Community Member and the Grantor. The Community shall not contact the Grantor in relation to the Services, other than through or with the prior written consent of OLS.

4. # STATUS 

   1. The relationship of each Community Member to OLS will be that of independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement shall render them an employee, worker, agent or partner of OLS and each Community Member shall not hold themselves out as such.

   2. A Community Member may, with the prior written approval of OLS, appoint a suitably qualified and skilled Substitute to perform the Services on their behalf, provided that the Substitute shall be required to enter into direct undertakings with OLS, including with regards to confidentiality. If OLS accepts the Substitute, the Community shall be jointly and severally responsible for the remuneration of the Substitute. For the avoidance of doubt, the relevant Community Member will continue to be subject to all duties and obligations under this Agreement for the duration of the appointment of the Substitute. 

   3. This Agreement constitutes a contract for the provision of the Services and not a contract of employment and accordingly each Community Member shall be fully responsible for, and shall indemnify OLS for all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities relating to:

      1. any income tax, National Insurance and social security contributions and any other liability, deduction, contribution, assessment or claim arising from or made in connection with the performance of the Services, where the recovery is not prohibited by law; and

      2. any liability arising from any employment-related claim or any claim based on worker status (including reasonable costs and expenses) brought by the Community Member or any Substitute against OLS arising out of or in connection with the provision of the Services, except where such claim is as a result of any act or omission of OLS.

   4. OLS may at its option satisfy such indemnity (in whole or in part) by way of deduction from any payments due to the Community.

   5. Each Community Member hereby appoints and authorises the Community Representative (as nominated by the Community and notified to OLS from time to time) to receive all correspondence \[and payments\] on its behalf. Each Community Member acknowledges and agrees that in the case OLS makes a payment or gives correspondence to the Community Representative, its obligation to do so has been fulfilled. 

5. # INDEMNITY \[AND INSURANCE\]

   1. Each Community Member shall jointly and severally indemnify OLS against all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and losses (including but not limited to any direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation and all interest, penalties and legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis) and all other professional costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by OLS arising out of or in connection with:

      1. any breach of the warranty contained in clause 18;

      2. a Community Member's breach or negligent performance or non-performance of this Agreement or the Services;

      3. the enforcement of this Agreement;

      4. any claim made against OLS for actual or alleged infringement of a third party's Intellectual Property Rights arising out of or in connection with the Services; and

      5. any claim made against OLS by the Grantor or a third party arising out of or in connection with the provision of the Services, to the extent that such claim arises out of the breach, negligent performance or failure or delay in performance of this agreement by the Community or its Substitute. 

   2. If payment due from the Community under this clause 5 is subject to tax (whether by way of direct assessment or withholding at its source), OLS shall be entitled to receive from the Community such amounts as shall ensure that the net receipt, after tax, to OLS in respect of the payment is the same as it would have been were the payment not subject to tax.

   3. Nothing in this clause 5 shall restrict or limit OLS's general obligation at law to mitigate any loss it may suffer or incur as a result of an event that may give rise to a claim under this indemnity.

   4. Liability under this indemnity is limited under clause 9 of this Agreement. 

   5. \[The Community shall maintain in force suitable insurance to cover any claim against Community Members, or any person that the Community engages whether the claim is because of this Agreement or for some other reason, and the Community shall supply proof of such insurance upon the written request of OLS\].

6. # FUNDS, FEES AND EXPENDITURE

   1. OLS shall pay to \[each Community Member / the Community Representative on behalf of the Community\] as full consideration for the performance of their duties under this Agreement the amounts and at the times set out in Schedule 4 ("**the Funds**") subject to:

      1. the Funds being available to OLS from the Grantor when the payment falls due;

      2. \[each Community Member / the Community Representative on behalf of the Community\] providing OLS with an invoice which is inclusive of all fees and taxes, dated, and containing a summary of the Services provided and the fee payable; 

      3. OLS being satisfied that such payment will be used for proper expenditure in the delivery of the Services; and

      4. each Community Member not being in breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Main Contract. 

   2. Subject to clause 6.3 of this Agreement, OLS shall pay each undisputed invoice submitted in accordance with 6.1.2 in full within 30 days of receipt. 

   3. OLS reserves the right to withhold payment of the Funds, or part of the Funds, if it is not satisfied (acting reasonably) with the quality of delivery of the Services, until such time as it is satisfied. Where OLS withholds payment of the Funds, or part of the Funds in accordance with this clause 6.3, this shall not be considered a breach of this Agreement.

   4. Each Community Member acknowledges and agrees:

      1. that it will not incur any expenditure in the name of or for the account of OLS or give the impression that it is allowed to do so unless the Community Member has been specifically authorised to do so in writing by OLS;

      2. that the Funds shall not be increased in the event of any overspend by the Community in its delivery of the Services;

      3. that OLS is not responsible for any taxes, currency conversions, transfer costs and other charges that may apply to the Funds (and to the extent that any such costs do apply, they shall be the responsibility of the Community); and

      4. to comply with, and provide reasonable assistance to OLS to ensure OLS's compliance with, all statutory requirements as regards accounts, audit or examination of accounts, annual reports and annual returns.

7. # INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

   1. All Background IPR is and shall remain the exclusive property of the party owning it (or, where applicable, the third party from whom its right to use the Background IPR has derived) and nothing in this agreement shall operate to transfer any Background IPR of one party to the other.

   2. Each party grants to the other party a worldwide, fully paid up, non-exclusive, non-transferable, sublicensable only in accordance with this agreement, royalty-free licence to use the first party's Background IPR to carry out the Project. Any license granted in accordance with this clause 7.2 shall terminate upon termination of this Agreement.

   3. OLS intends to make the Intellectual Property Rights granted to OLS under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic licence ("**CC BY 4.0 Licence"**) publicly available. Each Community Member permits OLS to license any Project materials on the same terms as the CC BY 4.0 Licence, permitting copying, redistribution, remixing, transformation, and building upon the Project materials, subject to giving appropriate credit to OLS, Grantor and/or the Community. 

   4. OLS shall be entitled to use and share with the Grantor or any other person specified in the Main Contract, any information or materials provided to it by the Community if required to do so under the Main Contract, and to grant to any person a sub-licence to the Community's Background IPR that are required for this purpose.

9. # LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   1. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude the liability of either OLS or the Community for:

      2. fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or wilful default; and

      3. any matter for which it would be unlawful to exclude or restrict liability.

   2. OLS shall not be responsible to any Community Member for any failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement where there is a corresponding failure by the Grantor to perform its obligations under the Main Contract, provided that OLS takes all reasonable steps to pursue its rights under the Main Contract.

   3. Subject to clause 9.1, the Parties acknowledge that OLS is entering into this agreement purely in its capacity as a fiscal host for the Community and Grantor and as such OLS' total aggregate liability to all of the Community Members (whether in contract, tort including negligence, breach of statutory duty, restitution or otherwise) in respect of all and any loss or damage howsoever caused will be limited to £1.00.

   4. Unless a Party notifies the other Parties that it intends to make a claim in respect of an event within the notice period, the other Parties shall have no liability for that event.
