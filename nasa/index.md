Funded by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), this program will deliver fully virtual training cohorts for the [NASA TOPS OpenCore training curriculum](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) with a 
highly qualitative component throughout the training. 

# About
      
Over three years starting in 2024, we will deliver five 6-week Virtual Cohorts per year. The cohorts will engage participants in hands-on implementation of open science concepts and tools. This program will teach one OpenCore Module per week, by bringing in speakers from across different scientific domains, allowing learners to actively embed their training in their work and reflect on their learning with guidance from expert practitioners.

# Timeline

The training will cover [the five modules in OpenCore](https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content), and participants will work with an expert to discuss real-world application of the skills they learn. The schedule for individual cohorts is shown below:

| Cohort timeline                 |                                | TOPS OpenCore modules |  Weeks           ||||||

The expected time commitment for this training is 4 hours per week. We plan to run **five cohorts per year**. 
We will run a pilot cohort in early 2024.
