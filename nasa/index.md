Get ready for an exciting project starting in 2024 in collaboration with [NASA-TOPS](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/).
**[Register your interest](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdalQ0drobXZWulNLyXYUUE6u5RUtX9HAetl8oPXvZYcnc0fw/viewform)**!

Funded by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), OLS will bring its globally successful cohort-based approach, incorporating a personal qualitative component throughout the training.

# About
      
OLS cohorts under the NASA-TOPS programme will offer 6-week-long Virtual Cohorts — not just one, but five of them each year over the next three years.

These cohorts will provide structured training covering the [Open Science 101 Curriculum](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/).
Each week, we will explore one open science module, with expert speakers from diverse scientific domains guiding hands-on learning.
OLS cohorts will uniquely feature practical assignments, empowering learners to actively implement open science concepts and tools in their work. 

While assignments facilitate reflection on learned concepts, expert coaching/consultation will further provide deeper insights and guidance from practitioners within the context of research.

*Transform your approach to open science dynamically over the next three years with us. Join us and redefine your scientific journey!*

# Timeline

The training will cover the five modules of the [Open Science 101 Curriculum](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/), and participants will work with an expert to discuss the real-world application of the skills they learn. The schedule for individual cohorts is shown below:

| Cohort timeline                 |                                | TOPS OpenCore modules |  Weeks           ||||||

The expected time commitment for this training is 4 hours per week. We plan to run **five cohorts per year**. 
We will run a pilot cohort in early 2024.
